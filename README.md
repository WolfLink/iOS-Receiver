# iOS-Receiver
Receive your OSX video stream from OSX-Streamer

<b>This is the companion application for https://github.com/WolfLink/OSX-Streamer/.  See that project for more information.</b>

Most of the app settings are in the streamer side.  The only thing you have to worry about on the iPhone side is to enter the same Connection ID.
